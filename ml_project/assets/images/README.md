# Placeholder for logo.png
# 
# To add your actual logo:
# 1. Create a 512x512 PNG image with transparent background
# 2. Place it at: assets/images/logo.png
# 3. Run: flutter pub get
# 4. Run: dart run flutter_native_splash:create
#
# This will automatically generate native splash screens for Android and iOS
# with your brand colors and logo.
#
# For now, the app uses the event icon from Material Icons.
